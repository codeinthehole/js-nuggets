Javascript nuggets
==================

Just a simple collection javascript utilities.

Scripts
-------
* *scripts/inspect.js*  - a simple object inspection utility.

Unit tests
----------
Each test has a corresponding unit test suite (written using the [http://www.jsunit.net/](jsunit) framework).
To run the tests, ensure that the folders are checked out to a web-readable folder, 
then point your browser to the test runner page at utils/jsunit/testRunner.html.  From there, you can paste in 
the path to the appropriate test file and run the tests.
